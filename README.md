# DroolsSpringBootIntegration

This project is an attempt to implement the production ready Drools services using the Spring Boot technology.

Though there are multiple ways to implement the Drools Rule engine & consume the same. I feel the embedded version is more relevant in case of Microservices architecture. Therefore I have created a SpringBoot project with the Drools library embedded, to expose the Drools rule engine functionality as a service.
